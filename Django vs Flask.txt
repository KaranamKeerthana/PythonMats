Overall - 
1) Both are used in high traffic websites.
2) Web framework for python.
3) Django full stack web development where as the flask is a micro and lightweight.
*4) Developers needs to keep in mind the needs of individual projects.

Django - 

*1) Django works on "Batteries included" priniciple.
    (Batteries Included means "all the packages are included" .....decrease dependency on external libs)
2) Django provides the Functional Admin Interface.
3) Django comes with a built in template engine that enables developers define the user facing layer . 
    jinja2 is inspired by Django's Template System. 
4) Django comes with the built in bootstrapping tool. It allows the developers to 
    divide the project into multipe new applications.
*5) Django has ORM system. Using ORM system we can work with widely used databases. 
    Also by using ORM developers can perform common database operations without writing 
    queries.
*6) developers has to build the web applications with the built in features provided making difficult to develop.
*7) Django is more powerful than Flask.
*8) Provides robust features to build and eploy cmplex web applications
*9) Django help developers to build large and complex web applications.


Flask - (prototypic applications)

1) Flask is a simple lightweight web framework. it lacks some of the built in features provided by Django. 
2) Flask templating is based on the jinja2.
3) Flask won't provide in built ORM system. We have to use SQLAlchemy package to work with databases.
4) Flask easier to learn than Django since it is micro. It helps the developers to build applications
    with the web development tools and libs.
*5)Flask is to accelerate development of simple websites that use "static content". Still have an option to customize the project.
*6) Useful to build restful APIs. 



*****   The modern approach to web development is to build restful APIs and we communicate to through HTTP.
