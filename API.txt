API - (Application Program Interface)

1) An API takes request , tells the system what to do and returns the response. 
    Eg: It is like a waiter in the restaurant (Who takes orders from you tells that in the kitchen, and gets the food to Us) .
2) Eg: When you want book a flight ticket not from the official website of an airlines, the travelling website talks with the airlines APIs where APIs fetch the details
    of the flights with the requirements to the websites.

RESTful API - 

*1)RESTful API is an Application Program Interface(API) which uses 'HTTP' requests to GET,PUT,POST,DELETE data.

*2) It is a service comprised of service operations which has a base URL. Service Operation == base URL + HTTP method
    Eg:
        1)  GET http://localhost:5050/extract
        2)  POSt http://localhost:5050/put

*3) client sends the URL + HTTP method to REST API. REST API contacts with the database. database sends the responds to REST API. REST API returns the response in the form of JSON/XML.

4) Stateless - 
    HTTP contains all the necessary information to run it, which means that neither the client nor the server need to remember any previous state.

5) HATEOAS -  (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State)
    1) It is a component of the REST . All REST APIs must have the HATEOAS.
    2) This principle is what ensures that each time a request is made to the server and it returns a response, part of the information it contains will be the browsing hyperlinks .
    *3) Allows the user to browse the set of objects through "HTML links".

6) Advantages of REST for Development - 
    1) The REST API is always "independent" of the type of platform or languages.
    2) Separation between the client and the server.

REST - (Representational State Transfer)

(One of the Pattern in APIs)

**1) REST is any "interface between systems" using "HTTP to obtain data" and generate operations on those data in all possible formats, such as "XML and JSON"(returns data). 
*2) REST technology is increasingly alternative to SOAP, which is complex.
3) REST is a logical choice for building APIs that allow users to connect and interact with cloud services.
4) All REST APIs must have the HATEOAS


METHODS - (HTTP Request Methods)

GET
---
1) It is used to fetch data from the server.
2) It cannot have a body(request)
3) No need of passing 'token' for GET

POST
----
1) It is essential to pass 'token' in POST


PUT
---
1) It is essential to pass 'token' in PUT
