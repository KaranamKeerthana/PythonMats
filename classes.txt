CLASSES
-------


(UpperCaseCamelCase convention)

-> In python we define class name with "Capital letter(Starting)".
    Eg: class PythonTest():

-> Non-public method (private methods of a class) should begin with a single underscore 
    Eg: def _split(self):

-> Double Underscore is for naming convention it is called "Name Mangling" .
    In present the variable is stored with the name of the class appended as prefix to that variable
    Eg: class Test:
            def __init__(self):
                self.__baz = 42

    * Here the variable is not stored as "__baz" but stored as "_Test__baz" providing a naming convention to avoid the collisions between the variable with similar name 
    when Test class got extended to the other class
