1) Why no do-while in python?
PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) to include do..while is rejected because it contadicts the python
general format 'statement: indented block' used by every other Python compound statement.

2)why no switch case in python?
Most programming languages have switch/case because they don't have proper mapping constructs. 
You cannot map a value to a function, that's why they have it. In python, they have dictionary to save
a value to the key.

3) Python Exit commands:
-> quit():
    1) It is SystemExit exception behind the scenes.
    2)Nevertheless, quit should not be used in production code
-> exit():
    1) It is an alias to quit(). 
    2) They exist simply to make python easy.
->* sys.exit():
    1) It raises the SystemExit exception similar to above.
    2) Unlike them it is good to use sys.exit() in production above.
-> os._exit():
    1) exits the program without calling cleanup handlers, flushing stdio buffers
    2) Not a standard way.
